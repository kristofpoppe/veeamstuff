disaster recovery plan
years or just deployed your first veeam
backup and replication console
we make it simple in order to create
those policies and maximize the uptime
availability of those tier one
applications
lab and take a look
at those steps needed in order to create
take a look at how we can create those
cdp
policies as well as edit but even more
importantly ensure
our our veeam console is set up in a way
where these
policies will function properly now we
have one already set in place but in
order to ensure that this is going to be
successful and syncing appropriately
if we want to dive into our backup
infrastructure and then
inside of our vcenter servers here right
here on the left hand side
if i do a right-click or two-finger
click i can then manage
and this will allow us to choose those
clusters or hosts that we want to go
ahead
and push that filter out to now this has
already been completed
in our lab but just hitting apply here
takes just a couple of seconds in order
to execute that process
now last but not least which we also
have another video diving a bit more
deeper on
is going to be our backup proxies now
our proxies are of course our heavy
lifters of the equations
for replicas a whole nine yards and in
veeam with cdp we have our unique
proxies
that we can just deploy same as we did
before by either doing that right click
or by leveraging some of the  the the
ribbons here in the top of the screen
so here we can add that veeam cdp proxy
and again check out the video we walk
through this really quickly
added that filter onto
all necessary vcenter servers and at
that point we can start creating those
vmware cdp policies now going back home
and into our job section just like
anything else we have our ribbons up top
and i can also do a right click in the
workspace here and create
another cdp policy so of course just
ahead and give it that policy name
as well as some advanced feature sets
such as replica seating
we can do some network remapping perhaps
run different virtual networks or even
re-iping
in the event that your dr site has a
different ip addressing scheme
so there we can also choose our virtual
machines this should look familiar for
we just choose those machines that we
want to go ahead and
add to the cdp policy and you can do
this by looking at hosts or clusters
vms templates tags the whole nine yards
but once we make those elections which
if you choose at higher levels
you can actually  make it autonomous
right so if you add
virtual machines or deprecate them out
well this cdp
policy will keep in line with that and
to date
now we choose this particular vm we can
go ahead and proceed through the wizard
go ahead and quickly choose its
destination here
and in the process we just need to
choose our resource pool as well as our
our vm folder and datastore if necessary
now this
pretty much being a small lab pretty
straightforward here and at that point
we can go ahead and proceed through the
wizard now keep in mind this is not only
for
you know your cdp and failing over but
this has long term
and short-term retention in the sense
that we can
you know keep these for longer periods
of time and actually have application
consistency we do this by you know
scheduling it appropriately which is the
next step
and maybe get a little bit ahead but
leveraging those source and target
proxies
to this policy
you just choose this choose option and
make those elections here
now we go into our schedule and then
give it that defined rpo and this is one
thing that is just brilliant notice we
can go down to two seconds if need be
this we can cater to our environment
needs
and then we can even choose our
short-term retention enabling those
point-in-time recoveries within a
certain amount of hours or even minutes
apart from that short-term retention we
actually my
my favorite aspect of cdp in a sense
that we can create those additional
restore points
and schedule this in a sense where we
can tell it when we want that crash
consistency or
default 24 7 is going to be
application consistent but perhaps you
just have a specific need
for perhaps you know late afternoon
only having crash consistent flexibility
is there for matching those needs so
once we proceed we can go ahead
and get those schedules in place and
then determine our guest
processing now this is nothing new this
just ensures that we quiesce those
applications before backing them up
and ensuring we get those nice clean cdp
rights over to that dr site so from
there
checking that box going into
applications we can handle
all pertinent information such as
permissions and users and whatnot here
now that is the long and short of
creating that cdp policy
and once this is completed just going
canceling out of this one
and see
different results and and you know the
performance of
that policy in action so we can even go
in see those restore points
the bottleneck the amount of data
transferred so it is giving us some
really great information
you know right in front of us no need to
dig deep to get these type of
data data points so thank you so much
for watching
and be sure to check out all the other
videos including
backup and replication office 365
and the list goes on we appreciate your
bye
