hello
and welcome to this demonstration today
veeam backup and replication to protect
your azure native workloads
directly from within the veeam backup
and replication
console
at how we do this
with a completely brand new
veeam backup and replication deployment
infrastructure right now
the first thing we need to do to get
started is add our azure
infrastructure into vm backup and
replication
we do this by going to backup
infrastructure
and picking manage servers we simply
right click
and say we want to add a server
and in the same way that we can protect
our vsphere or hyper-v
infrastructure our windows and linux
agents
we can add in public cloud protection as
aws or microsoft azure so with this
being a
veeam backup for microsoft azure
already a veeam backup for microsoft
azure customer
you can actually connect veeam backup
and replication
to your existing veeam backup for
microsoft azure appliance
environment
and we want to go and protect our azure
workloads
microsoft azure
we want to just manage that
protected
any of our azure infrastructure so we
simply pick
deploy a new appliance and veeam backup
and replication will walk us through a
wizard
allowing us to connect to our microsoft
azure subscriptions
so we say next and the first thing that
is our microsoft azure account
microsoft azure accounts in vm backup
and replication you can manage these
accounts here
but as this is a brand new install we
actually have to add in
just add this
we pick whether we want to do microsoft
azure or azure stack
because we want to protect our workloads
out in the public cloud
subscription
so do we want to create a new account or
use an existing account
to create a new account
so we click configure account the first
thing that we do is we add in our azure
email address our azure account we paste
our password
and we sign in veeam backup and
replication will now
go and import all the subscription
information
for that microsoft azure account so now
that our account has been added
we can see that we have the subscription
there we simply say
next and finish we can see that we have
now our azure account in our manage
our azure credentials so now we can move
on to
configuring subscriptions and how we
want to configure
the veeam backup for microsoft azure
appliance
subscription do you want to pick so if
you have multiple
azure subscriptions this is supported so
what data center do we want to deploy
the east coast of the us
and do we want to create a new resource
group or use
existing resource group
resource group for
the appliance the veeam backup for
microsoft azure appliance to
this
vbr azure demo
and now we can have
veeam backup and replication configure
our networks for this to use
or we can use pre-populated ones
we can have the virtual networks the
subnets
whatever we pick here we can use
pre-determined ones
or we can just have it create new ones
just going to have it create
all new ones we say next
do we want to use a dynamic ip address
or a static ip address
so depending on what your configuration
options are around
ip addressing in microsoft azure you can
pick either one of these
you can also have veeam backup and
replication
use pre-determined ip addresses if you
have
any static ip addresses configured
dynamic and have the backup of
replication create these
next what we want to do is create some
credentials for the administrator
account
on veeam backup for microsoft azure so
just a username and password
and then we can use existing key pairs
or we can add
use a default key pair and veeam backup
and replication will actually go and
have any pre-populated
say next and now the deployment
of this configuration will begin and it
and there we have it we are now able to
go and configure our backups in
microsoft azure so you can see that that
was pretty simple happened pretty
quickly
smary make sure everything we put in
there
is acceptable and now we can actually go
and
open the wizard to
create some backup repositories in azure
blob storage
so we simply enable the tick box and we
say finish
and this will launch the adding of the
external repositories
in veeam backup and replication so the
first thing we do
is we pick our appliance we give this a
repository name so
say next pick our microsoft azure
credentials
pre-populated storage accounts
in the same way that we added the
microsoft azure subscription
we can add in our azure storage accounts
as well
say next
now we pick our azure containers
so we pick from a list of containers
want to pick this one
do we want to enable file encryption so
encryption at rest
password
create a hint and veeam backup and
replication will now go away and create
an appropriate
azure blob backup repository so that we
can store
azure in this repository
and we simply click finish we can see
our microsoft azure infrastructure
intervene backup and replication
so the first thing that we want to do is
go and create
a backup job so we can actually protect
some of our azure virtual machines
running
so we simply right click we pick backup
and we see that we have
microsoft azure we are now presented
with the ad
policy wizard for veeam backup for
microsoft azure so we will give this
policy a name of demo first job say net
we get to pick our sources so what azure
account
do we want to use what regions do we
going to pick central us for this
say add so now we want to pick the
resources that we want to protect
so we say select resources we have the
option to protect
just selected
or we have the ability to break this
down via subscriptions
resource groups virtual machines or even
tags
if we want to automate these backups
from a list so i will simply pick
this particular windows virtual machine
apply
so we notice that we now have the
ability to protect one resource in this
policy
next we have the ability to turn on
application aware backup so if we want
to do
any application aware snapshots if we
want to do any
pre or post scripts for windows or linux
we could add that here
now we have the ability to turn on
backups so
want to take some snapshots of these
virtual machines but we want to turn
on backups so that we can actually
offload our snapshots out to the azure
blob
backup repository we just configured so
this is gives you a lot of granular
control over your scheduling you can
pick
when you want your snapshots and your
backups to be taken
and then we pick how many snapshots we
want to keep and how long we want to
keep the backups for
finally we say where what repository
do we want to put our backups into so
created earlier
next we come to one of the very unique
features that show you
the costs of protecting your workloads
that are running out in the public cloud
so we can see here this gives us some
information around how much the
snapshots are going to cost
how much the backups are going to cost
and the total cost
of what this backup policy is so this
gives you a lot of control over what
backup policies and jobs out in the
cloud that are going to cost us
thousands of dollars a month for a very
small
windows virtual machine next we just
finish through the settings
and we simply say finish that policy is
created
we go back to veeam backup and
replication
run this backup job protect all our
infrastructure and manage that
through veeam backup and replication
so thank you very much for watching this
quick demonstration
microsoft azure native workloads
natively through veeam backup and
replication
for more information go to veeam.com
and start having a look at how veeam
backup and replication
can provide you with the capabilities to
protect
all your data in this multi-cloud world
thank you very much

[Applause]
