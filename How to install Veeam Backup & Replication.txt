going to walk you through the
installation of veeam backup and
replication and share some tips on
getting the install right
through a couple of components and just
focusing on here so when i look at a
veeam deployment i have a nber of
different components of course i have
the 
you know source infrastructure here so
hypervisors agents that sort of stuff
i have my veeam proxies which in a
virtual environment are responsible for
consing the data from the source
and i have my veeam repositories which
is where my backup archives are going to
be stored so those could be standalone
repositories it could be a scale out
backup repository with offload to public
cloud
is really the brains of the veeam backup
and replication deployment which is the
veeam backup and replication server
what this installation looks like and
some things to look out for
going to download veeam backup and
replication i already have a license key
here but of course you can download
and get a trial key or even just run
community edition from this single
download
iso and i can kick off the installation
process so a few things to note here
 of course the big install button is
second but you can also use this as a
launch pad to get to their product
docentation to get to further training
videos
and then install the standalone
all-in-one install so
veeam backup and replication itself is
the
coordinator component inside
a veeam
component deployment
 and a couple of other functions
the install veeam backup enterprise
manager
is our web-based management tool for the
veeam backup and replication
infrastructure it serves a couple of
functions typically in a veeam
deployment first of all it provides
federation if you have multiple veeam
backup and replication servers
it also provides a searchable index if
workload backups so 
in addition to things like role-based
access control and some self-service
capabilities those kind of things but
video
the veeam backup and replication console
itself is where you install the console
standalone so you have a veeam backup
and replication server deployed
console somewhere else maybe in your
desktop
to be able to access the console and do
configuration
we also have the ability to deploy the
enterprise application plugins so these
are plugins for
applications like oracle rman or sap
hana so that we can use those mechanisms
to back up to veeam
repositories
but for the purposes of this video we
are going to run through the
installation of veeam backup and
replication so the first thing we get is
the end user license agreement of course
please read this carefully
you and click next
provide the license file for veeam
backup and replication so you know find
from veeam or
you can go ahead and just install in
license file
the all-in-one install here we get the
veeam backup and replication server
itself we get the veeam backup catalog
which is the component that
actually consolidates the
index files that we get through file
system indexing and then can share them
with the veeam enterprise manager to do
files you know searches for particular
files or metadata about those files as
part of the recovery process
and the veeam backup and replication
console so this is the
the windows based console that we can
use to configure veeam
one other thing to note in this dialog
is just the installation directory now
files here but one thing you want to be
aware of is well first of all of course
itself but also where the log files for
the application are going to be stored
so veeam
happening inside the application of
course you can use that for
troubleshooting or auditing or a variety
of functions
the log files can get quite big so
the system requirements to make sure
files but they also benefit from being
on faster storage
so
to just you know my c drive see program
files here
but after the fact i might go and change
the location of the log files so do
check the product docentation for how
to do that and consider where you want
your vm log files to be based
generally especially in larger
deployments we want those log files to
be on a separate desk and often that
separate this would we would expect to
be fast so you know like ssd or
something like that so just be mindful
of that
next we are going to provide the service
account context for the veeam backup and
replication service
selected at local system but just kind
of a general point on vman and accounts
veeam does not need to be deployed
inside an active directory domain i mean
it can be
but it does not require to be actually
none of the veeam components need to be
domain joined
as a general recommendation we actually
recommend that the veeam components are
deployed away from your production
active directory domain maybe in
standalone workgroup or maybe in a
management domain that is specifically
configured for management functions
inside your organization
the veeam backup and replication
database so this will be a microsoft sql
server instance
it could be deployed locally on the
veeam backup and replication server it
could be on a remote sql database it
could be deployed into a sql always on
availability group or other cluster
technology do check the product
docentation for those configurations
by default
will actually download install deploy
microsoft sql express
for smaller deployment sql express may
limitations you need to be aware of
though  the first one is the size of
the database can only be up to 10 gig
which honestly for the veeam backup and
replication database is fine for the
vast majority of deployments the vbr
database never gets that big but the
other limitations might lean you more
towards using sql standards so
those limitations with sql express are
that sql express can only use the first
four processing cores on the first cpu
so that could be a limiting  compute
factor and also sql express will only
use the first gigabyte of ram configured
processing cores
so generally working with customers we
find that the 10 gig database limit
factor in larger deployments it tends to
be the compute restrictions that
microsoft place on sql express so
take those you know take those things
under consideration
make the decision about which sql
instance is going to work best for you
context for connecting to sql so that
could be
windows authentication credentials
it could be
you know built-in sql server
authentication credentials
so provide that
and move on to the next step
configuration so beam backup and
replication configures a nber of
default ports if i want to change these
i can if i have a policy around which
ports are allowed and disallowed that
kind of stuff i can configure the
the ports here
okay next up a couple of data locations
that we want to configure that you may
want to be aware of
so
the first is the instant recovery rate
cache so when
veeam does an instant vm recovery so
starting a virtual machine directly from
the backup archive so without having to
restore all the blocks and all that
stuff we can just power the vm on
directly from the backup archive now we
keep that backup archive read-only
so that means that the changes that get
made whilst the instant vm is running
have to be stored somewhere
this is that somewhere we specify the
location for the instant recovery cache
 and then what will happen is that if
the instant recovery session i then want
to migrate it back into production
 veeam is smart enough to take the
read-only version of the the vm running
from the backup archive and the changes
in the instant recovery right cache and
merge those together as part of the
you know as part of the restore back to
production process
the other location i might want to
configure here is the guest file system
catalog so this is part of the file
system indexing function that veeam
provides
so i want to provide a location for that
for the workloads managed by this vbr
instance okay so last step really i just
check all the variables that are
provided make sure that everything looks
good
i can also check for updates immediately
upon the product installation so those
will be downloaded and installed
and then i click install
okay and now our installation has
succeeded
so
what we
end up with is the veeam backup and
replication console on the desktop here
so i can simply open that up connect in
protecting my data
thanks for watching this video please
