hello and welcome to veeam in this brief
video i want to show you a few things
that go into answering the question what
type of backup should i take
different ways you can back up data and
recently the veeam platform is really
incredible can do nearly anything you
might need to do in regards to backup
that makes sense because our mission
is to be the most trusted provider of
backup solutions that deliver modern
data protection
different ways you can have backups done
with veeam one of the most
all-encompassing and really frequent
ways to do backups is an image level
backup now this is a great way to back
up a virtual machine a physical server
and you know have everything you need
but it also works for workstations and
endpoints as
well now the image level backup is great
fully portable almost any scenario we
can restore to the cloud to different
hypervisors back to bare metal a lot of
flexibility
the next level is maybe a little bit
more specific for certain systems where
you know the different data type and
those are vole level backups just this
drive just this drive letter a very
specific way to do some sort of captures
pretty attractive as well you can
entertain backing up just this folder
also something that you can use for our
nas backup engine which is a recent
to backup
large expanses of data on nas systems
more options across all the different
data you might have and you can mix and
match one of the other ones that comes
up a lot are around some of the
enterprise apps and there are two
plugins in particular i want to
highlight
oracle with rmn as well as sap hana
now these plugins and sap for oracle as
well
these plugins will back up the
application kind of in native terms
where those applications drive the
backups and veeam provides the storage
now you can get into some very
interesting combinations where i might
back up with both an image level backup
and these application backups you might
also do an image level backup with one
system and pull some files out as well
because you might have different
retention requirements
have with the veeam platform now most of
this is driven by veeam backup and
replication the veeam agents can help
out as well as these plugins and then
also if you think about the cloud and 
the different other backup products we
have like casting k10 by veeam as well
as veeam backup for microsoft office 365
the platform is really growing and
look at a quick demo of veeam backup and
of these different backup types in
action
want to show you a few things
going to highlight here this is a
windows agent job so the veeam agent for
sql server database inside of a
protection group now this is using the
image based backup but let me show you a
few options that help set this up
really cool option to either manage it
by the backup server or by the
collecting
manage it by the backup server so all
the options are centralized which is
really versatile on scale
or i could have independent agents with
their own settings that come in to be
very flexible
which computers which would be a
protection group and these are sql
server systems that are dynamically
discovered and this can be through
active directory organizational units it
can be through ip addresses and name
lists it can be through a csv file
exported from your cmdb and it even has
the ability to do a catch-all type of
protection group
now the protection
of these agents is set right here which
mode am i going to do these backups with
so that entire computer that image based
backup that would be that setting right
here
now the other option i can do is
potentially if i wanted to do a vole
level backup so just a few drive letters
like the entire computer but if you have
really big systems sometimes you get
into different drives have different
types of backups and then the other
thing you can entertain is is file level
because i have a better way to do that
second but you have a lot of options now
they each have their own benefits their
own use cases and when you play with the
different
find that some of these make a little
bit of sense for your different
configurations
so the next option is where are we going
to put these backups so when i look at
the
backups that we do here at veeam one of
the first questions i always get is how
much storage do i need and in this
deduplication appliance but i have a
couple of options around how much do i
points here so in this environment
options to to set that up and you can
make backup copy jobs go longer with
image-based backups and you can even see
i can even get into some of the
say multiple backups per day
then i can build my retention to be
based on days versus restore points so

i mentioned that this is a sql server
and consistency is one of the things
that make a big difference for
applications
so
the magic here is the application aware
setting here
now this particular protection group has
sql server virtual machines in it and i
have a really good couple of options in
here one is
that i want to back up the logs every
five minutes
next
part of the wizard
the backup job runs once a day so at
face value you might think my recovery
point objective is 24 hours
able to get a recovery point objective
of five minutes because i can drive log
based recovery with with veeam
technology here so very easy way to do
this and we have a similar set of
capabilities for oracle as well as a
plug-in directly to oracle our man so
you have so many different ways to do
over at the help center
and then the last option is the schedule
day at six pm so again i have a daily
recovery point objective for the whole
image based backup
those logs
just like that that job is easy to go
ready and
taking backups
now the next image based backup i want
to show you is a vmware backup job so
this is kind of one of the types of jobs
that veeam is known for right those
image-based virtual machine backups and
whether you have vmware hyper-v nutanix
or some of the other hypervisors you
have great options here with veeam
see even though i went from a physical
server backup now to a virtual machine
backup a lot of these options are the
same
and then
to back up so i have three nothing fancy
nothing huge but nonetheless i have
three virtual machines
do i want to put these backups
so guess what similar type of answers
deduplication appliance i have the same
type of retention so as i build these
going to start to see
a recurring theme of some of the common
ways to build backup jobs with veeam
same thing restore points or days
and then i get into the
retention and
the application aware image processing
settings so i have same options set for
both file system indexing and
application aware image processing which
will drive me the best type of backup to
take
of these systems ensuring the healthiest
potential recovery
copies going on because there is no sql
oracle et cetera on these so this is a
24-hour rpo set to run every day at 7 pm
so now the last job i want to show you
is a file share backup so this is a
relatively new type of backup with veeam
so
in the previous example i showed that
you could do an image level backup
a vole level backup or file level
backup and you can actually still do
that but if you have a lot of files to
backup this is the way this is the file
share backup of the nas engine
so again i set a name for a job pretty
straightforward
share do i want to back up so i have
bunch of webcam scrapes and the like i
want to back that up
and i can add other file shares that i
might have if i have any in the
environment which i do and i can even
browse down and find some of the
different
folders so even within a file share if i
really wanted to protect you know
silicon lift and oxygen blow for example
you could protect those differently than
you could say the whole thing
the questions start getting the same
on that same dedupe appliance but
things that are a little bit unique to
the file share backup
one
is
file shares and file backups are a
little bit different than the image
vmware virtual machines hyper-v nutanix
and physical servers
file share backups we entertain the idea
of versions or revisions of the file so
versions for the last 25 days
or sorry 28 days but you can also get
like
so with this option here i can keep the
previous file versions for say three
years
if i needed that long term retention and
i could even use the cloud if i wanted
to
so i have a lot of different options
here and i could also take these backups
and put them on a secondary target so
one of the regular storage repositories
that i have in my environment this is
the list of those if i wanted to have a
second copy for that three two one rule
and then the schedule
sounds familiar this schedule is very
similar to the rest of the scheduling
and again it just quickly and easily
a couple of different ways that you can
make
you know image-based backups of virtual
machines and then also some of the
configuration options for physical
share backups and those are just a quick
about some of the other operating
systems other hypervisors or even the
cloud beam has a lot of great ways that
you can do these incredible backup types
presentation that will show you a little
bit more about the platform
trusted provider of backup solutions
that deliver modern data protection and
really builds off the technology i just
demoed to you
so the different backup solutions go
really across all of the different data
sources that you might be using right
this portfolio of backup solutions
using today and i only showed you a
vmware backup a sql server windows
backup and a file share backup but
so the reality is when we say modern
analytics and monitoring as well as
orchestration and automation with
governance and compliance all of these
capabilities build this broader set of
options i mean people come to us for
backup but then when we think about
having this cloud data management
platform in play all of these
really powered a lot by veeam backup and
replication you know the product that
gave you that really quick demo with all
so many other stories that can go with
it but i hope that that gives you a
really quick view of the veeam cloud
data management platform
scenarios where veeam and the different
technologies can really capture data and
do these various types of flexible
backups across your environment now if
