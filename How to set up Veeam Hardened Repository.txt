these days unfortunately malicious
actors
malware even potentially insider attacks
are a big concern that we need to
address to solve this
veem now introduces the hardened
repository which includes the feature of
immutability
down
and delete backup files before a
certain amount of time has passed even
if you are the backup administrator
this is a capability we have on linux
repositories
also known as a hardened repository
today let me take you through a process
of setting up a hardened repository
and enabling immutability inside that
repository
inside the lab we basically want to go
down to backup
backup repositories
click add repository
which would be a linux zone
pick linux
the next step is to actually add this
repository in
we will simply call it buttons
repository click next
then we have to pick which server it is
in this case i have some
learning service already but this is not
add new type in the host name
next how do we connect to this so
initially
to set this up you will need to have ssh
use
directory on this server which is
available to
own
chmod which would be
use to connect here would be
beam rep one my password
connect
in and install a veeam data mover
service which will run with reduced
privileges but we do need root here
initially to
given this account
need to
take this in here in any way you can
even call this a
single use credential
will have a fingerprint of course we
could from the server
to go and double check its fingerprints
okay so we can see our transport or
veeam data move search will be installed
so this will take just a little bit and
we can see the data mover search is
getting installed here
all of this you can essentially go down
to have it running
if you do want to keep it running you
could essentially firewall it only
allowing
certain machines on the network to
connect using ssh for
security purposes but you definitely
would want to make sure that root is not
able to connect in
because the way this immutability works
is essentially that only the
root account would be able to remove the
eye
or immutability flag on files
to click next and finish
now a managed server and we can continue
the
process of setting up the new repository
click populate here
which will give us an overview of the
different drives that are available
okay i will be using this backups xfs
drive to store my backups on click next
okay we can see the capacity and free
space is unknown
simply click populate to just confirm
that we did in fact select the right
drive here
if we use xfs voles you could
take a look at one of our
other videos for more information about
this specific feature
immutable so basically here i can decide
how long should these be immutable this
is for
our primary jobs and the primary chain
if you have gfs for backups notice here
they are made immutable for the entire
duration of their retention policy so
i could say i want to always guarantee
that they will be here for
31 days no one can delete them during
this
process click next if we need to mount
to pick either a backup server or
maybe another windows baser to act as
the
mount server click next
this takes us through a little review
here we can see everything is already
set up so
basically just click apply
and that basically it we can see the
process is finished
next finished and my hardened repository
able to start setting up new jobs
targeting this repository or i could
even start handing in
as a scale out back repository
thank you so much for watching this
video and we hope to see you in
another video
you
