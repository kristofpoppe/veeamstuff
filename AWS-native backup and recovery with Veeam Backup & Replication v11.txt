hello
and welcome to this demonstration today
protect my aws workloads natively
through veeam backup and replication
fresh
backup infrastructure of veeam backup
and replication
and we simply want to go and protect our
aws
workloads once we have veeam backup and
replication deployed
the first thing that we do is we
navigate to our backup infrastructure
and
we go to our managed servers we simply
right click
and say add server this is where we can
add
all the infrastructure that we want to
protect through veeam backup and
replication
windows linux agents or we want to
protect our workload
running out in the public cloud in aws
or microsoft azure
so we simply pick veeam backup for
aws
now we have two choices here if we were
an existing
veeam backup for aws customer we would
be able to connect
to an already existing appliance but in
this scenario
we simply want to deploy a new appliance
workloads before
so we say we want to deploy a new
appliance
now we can pick our aws accounts
so we add in our aws access keys
once we paste in our access keys which
have been blurred out
for security reasons we simply say ok
then we pick where we want
to deploy the appliance which will help
us protect
those workloads very simply very easily
to pick
north virginia we say next
vbr aws demo
now we have the options to either use
existing
vpc configurations or create new ones
for the appliance to use we can specify
an existing one
pick subnets security groups
whatever we have pre-populated in our
vpcs in that data center
to say create new and veeam backup and
replication will go and create
everything that we need and configure
all the networking we need
for this to work
we have the option of picking either
dynamic or static
just going to simply pick dynamic
but if we had elastic ips configured
in that data center in that virtual
private cloud
we could also pick a static ip
now we create some administrator
credentials
for the appliance and we pick
a key pair now we can
create a key pair if we wanted to or we
can use some pre-existing
key pairs that have already been created
in aws ec2
appliance to deploy
replication to
be able to protect our aws
smary of our configuration options are
and we also have the ability to now
create
a s3 backup repository so an aws
object storage backup repository
directly through
this veeam backup and replication wizard
so we picked the
tick box enable that and we simply say
finish this will allow us to configure
that backup repository
configured we give it
a repository name
and then we pick the aws account that we
added in the credentials of
earlier and we we can pick out aws
regions and we say next
we pick the data center and
we simply browse for buckets
we can enable encryption
and add passwords into this for
encryption
and we can create a hint as well so
we always know what our password is
once we have that backup repository
registered
that gives us all the details around
and we simply say finish we can see that
we now have an
aws backup appliance deployed allowing
us to go and protect our
infrastructure in aws
automatically created is a vpc
configuration backup job
that will run and detect all our virtual
private cloud configuration settings
across all our data centers that we have
configured
in our aws account
now we can create our first backup job
so we right click and we go through our
menu option to create a backup job
and we can specify whether we want to
create an ec2
or an rds backup job now we get
presented
with this html ui that allows us to
create
call this
first job policy
we say next
what aws account do we want to use so if
we
have added in multiple aws accounts
actually pick those specify a region
particular region here
now we can actually pick what we want to
protect
whether we want to protect all resources
individual instances or
whether we want to do it via tags if we
just pick
a particular instance
just going to protect our ubiquity
networks
we can exclude voles if we want to we
can turn on
application aware backups if we want to
do we want to replicate snapshots to
different accounts in different regions
configuring
our snapshots to be offloaded into that
object
storage s3 repository that we created
when we were configuring our aws
appliance
we say apply then we can pick our
daily backup of this
how often do we want to take our backups
lunchtime how many snapshots do we want
to keep and how many restore points do
we want to keep
feature in
protecting your public cloud workloads
a cost estimator or a cost calculator
and we can see here that the cost is
4.29 to protect this particular workload
based on our snapshots backup traffic
and transaction costs
and then we simply say finish
and there we have it our first backup
job has been
created in veeam backup and replication
and we can now protect
our workloads natively
through veeam backup and replication we
can see that we have
our snapshots configured
