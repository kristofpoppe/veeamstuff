protect your
nas files your workloads using vm backup
and replication
to do this of course we need a source to
pull data out from
is actually extracting the data
from your nas workloads but we also will
use a component called
a cache repository the cache repository
is used for handling
incremental backups so that instead of
producing full backups of
all your files and folders every day we
can basically
during the first run produce a checks
of every file and folder
store that on our cache repository so
that the next time we do an incremental
run
we can basically check on the top level
which folders have
changed doing a checks for the entire
folder
if we see something has changed we can
then go into that one folder
and start checking each file and folder
this is significantly
faster than checking every single file
and folder
individually instead of only checking
the folders where we know
that some changes have been made finally
of course we need a target which would
be a
normal backup repository as we know it
from starting agent backups
and virtual machine backups what kind of
sources could we extract backups from
it could be a windows server file share
it could be a linux server file share
but it could also be a network share
running on nfs
deploy these jobs
inside the lab inside the lab
we first will have to go and actually
get some components deployed
we do that by going to backup
infrastructure here we see we just have
go and click add repository
and add up that file share cache
that
file chair
repository
yes
repository click next
back server itself for now
just to keep things simple this could of
course be only different so
something here
yes right
next next
why this will take just a little bit of
time
next finish
click no here okay so now we have our
cash repository set up
the next thing would be to go and create
a job now
and this actually opens up the add file
share wizard
i could also click cancel here the way
you do this without
clicking the job button has to go to
inventory select file shares
and then we can even see sort of the
listed steps of what should we do
use an smb
share here as the example type in the
f
and the share that we want to use
use
backup proxy which one would we use 
it
can be a the same backup proxy that we
also use for virtual
machines you could of course have
use the default one cache repository
we want to use the one we just created
this should
be as close to the nas as possible so
warning here select the repository
located in close proximity to the file
share
we have some i o control here generally
i would recommend just leaving the
default here
but you can go and adjust this if you
can see that the load on your nas is
very low and you want
backups to complete faster you can pull
it in this direction
if you think the load on your nas is too
high
more time you could
move to the left towards lower impact
click apply
added in
okay pretty fast finish so now we have
set up we can even see the next step is
literally to create a backup job so why
call that name here file share backup
prior priority if you want to use that
next okay so what is it that we want to
protect well we can click add
and we see our nas here we could even go
generally one job per share should be
the individual
folders inside now notice here if we
select this
click advanced we have some include
masks to say include everything
but there are some folders excluded by
default which is
storage snapshots on your
nas cancel out click next
okay so where do we want these backups
to go i just want them to go to my
backup
repository the default one how many file
versions do we want to keep
for the last x days or months
one month so
31 days or i could even say one month if
now notice here it says keep all file
versions
get created in this month we will keep
all of them
however if you want to limit this
because you know you have a lot of
versions getting created we could click
advanced down here and instead of saying
keep all versions
you could also say well i want to limit
to a certain amount of active
and a certain amount of deleted
generally i would recommend just keeping
all unless you have a specific needs
show you the next tab acl handling
normally by default background
replication will grab the permissions
attributes only on a folder basis
if you go to file level and change
permissions then you would need to set
this
radio button here files and folders
files individually
which also means that when we restore
worth and they would inherit from the
folder
this is a little bit slower but that
might be required for you if you set it
on
keep it down here just to be
sure running through we have compression
optimal is always recommended so unless
you have specific needs
just leave it here maintenance some
storage level corruption guards
where you can take a closer look in one
of our other videos if you want to learn
more about this feature
the agents for example
scripts if you have some certain script
maybe to produce a
story snapshot or something like that
notifications
here we have some severity options and
these are actually quite
nice basically what happens when the job
runs
make a backup
often if that happens we have to skip
the files
errors or warnings but if you want that
to actually trigger a warning then you
can go and set these
check boxes here this is for file
processing this is for
these as okay
now we also could go and say i want to
archive something so that
you for example take older versions of
files
and send them off to some different
location here i just have the one
repository but
you could add in multiples and if you
enable this
how long would you want to keep them one
two three years or certain amount of
that in this example
like next some secondary location we
could go and
going to do that in this video
and finally our schedule of course you
want this job to run automatically
how often should it run should it run
every day
what what time should it run maybe you
want to run it multiple times per day so
you could go and say well it should be
looking to
backup your files twice a day for
example
click apply and we also want
finish
go up to our home view we can see the
file backup job and the one that we
created
click on that
already processing click show details
calculate the file shift size
basically
it very very easy to work with
and i hope you enjoyed this video
you
