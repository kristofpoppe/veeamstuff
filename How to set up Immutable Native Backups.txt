there are a lot of threats to your data
at veeam our goal is to keep that data
secure and be available for restore when
you need it one of the best ways to do
that is to follow the 32110
rule here at veeam which includes having
offline air gapped or otherwise
immutable
having native immutable backups is very
easy to do here at veeam two particular
capabilities can do that with no
additional beam cost one is the hardened
linux repository and the other is s3
object lock immutability that comes with
the public aws s3 storage or
with a nber of different service
providers or on-prem unified storage
systems offering that as well
and replication console here i have a
nber of different backup jobs going to
a target which is a repository
two of these are of particular interest
the first one is the hardened linux
repository where i have some backups
going and then the other one
is the immutable backups to the cloud
these are repositories that are set up
with immutability either on-prem or in
the cloud so we have a lot of
flexibility there
if i take a look at the backup
infrastructure you can see a list of all
of those different repositories again
that is the target for backup jobs
immutable backups and then the hardened
linux repository they sit alongside all
of the other different repositories but
they have two special
configuration items that make a big
difference for the reliability of this
public aws s3 immutable backups
this particular repository is part of a
scale out backup repository serving as
the capacity tier with a couple of
setting that these backups are marked as
immutable
for 30 days
using the scale out backup repository
with copy mode that will put the backups
that are taken immediately into the
scale out backup repository with that
immutability
the second repository i want to show is
the hardened linux repository and
immutable for 14 days on this particular
type of repository it uses the xfs file
system
on linux with no additional beam cost to
achieve this type of immutability on
premises with basically no barrier of
entry
you can also use this in conjunction
with the scale out backup repository as
well
so a nber of different ways you can do
immutability in addition to some of the
other capabilities we have such as tape
removable drives and more and what
really matters is having some form of
the 32110
rule implemented in your organization
that specifies to have three different
copies of data on two different media
one of those is off-site
and then additionally one of those
copies be either offline air-gapped or
immutable and then have complete
zero errors with sure backup recovery
verification
now there are a nber of different ways
you can do that here with veeam and it
hardware or technology yet it can
be recoverable against nearly any
failure scenario all of this is really
good stuff and if you like what you see
